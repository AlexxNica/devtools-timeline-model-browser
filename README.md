# devtools-timeline-model-browser

Browser-friendly library for parsing DevTools Timeline traces into structured profiling data models.
Heavily inspired by [devtools-timeline-model](https://github.com/paulirish/devtools-timeline-model). 
Should work in any modern browser.

## Develop

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/devtools-timeline-model-browser
$ cd devtools-timeline-model-browser
$ npm install
# or $ yarn if you have yarn installed
```

To build the source run `webpack` or `npm run build`.

## Usage

`dist` contains a globals-friendly `timeline-model-browser.js` build that can be dropped into any page. e.g:

```html
<script src='dist/timeline-modal-browser.js'></script>
```

From there, you'll have access to a new global, `TimelineModelBrowser` that can be passed the contents of any
valid trace file.

```js
const traceFileContents = '...'; // Let's pretend you've fetched a trace file
const model = new TimelineModelBrowser(traceFileContents);
```

You'll now have access to the same helpers available in the [devtools-timeline-model](https://github.com/paulirish/devtools-timeline-model) package:

```js
// tracing model
model.tracingModel()
// timeline model, all events
model.timelineModel()
// interaction model, incl scroll, click, animations
model.interactionModel()
// frame model, incl frame durations
model.frameModel()
// filmstrip model, incl screenshots
model.filmStripModel()

// topdown tree
model.topDown()
// bottom up tree
model.bottomUp()
// bottom up tree, grouped by URL
model.bottomUpGroupBy('URL') // accepts: None Category Subdomain Domain URL EventName
```

## Demo

A demo that uses the `dist` build is available in the `demo` directory. Fire up a local server in the repo root,
then navigate to `/demo/` to try it out.

Note: Your browser will need to support the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) for the
demo to correctly work. This should include browsers like Chrome, Opera, Firefox and the Safari Tech Preview.

## Why

[devtools-timeline-model](https://github.com/paulirish/devtools-timeline-model) is an excellent package if you're trying
to build tools targeting a Node environment that want to parse DevTools traces into an easy to reason about model. A few
assumptions are built into that package, including use of Node built-ins, such as `fs`, `resolve` and so on.

I found that shimming these with `browserify-fs` and the `brfs` transforms were not sufficient to create a browser-friendly
version of that package, so this is a complimentary repo that lets you easily reuse that work in the browser.
